Redwood National and State Parks (RNSP) is a network of protected areas along the northern coast of California, USA, renowned for its towering coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), the tallest trees in the world. The park system includes Redwood National Park (established in 1968) and three state parks: Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park.

Key Features:
1. Geography:
Spanning over 139,000 acres (560 square kilometers), the park system includes old-growth forests, prairies, rivers, and coastal ecosystems.
The region features dramatic landscapes, from rugged coastlines to dense forests, and is bisected by rivers like the Smith, Klamath, and Eel.
2. Redwoods:
The park protects 45% of the remaining old-growth coast redwood forests in the world.
Coast redwoods are the tallest living trees, with some reaching heights over 380 feet (115 meters) and living for more than 2,000 years.
3. Biodiversity:
Flora: Beyond redwoods, the park hosts Douglas firs, western hemlocks, ferns, mosses, and wildflowers.
Fauna: Home to a variety of wildlife, including Roosevelt elk, black bears, bobcats, river otters, and several bird species like bald eagles and marbled murrelets.
Coastal and river ecosystems support salmon, sea lions, and other aquatic species.
4. Cultural and Historical Significance:
The area has been inhabited for thousands of years by Indigenous peoples, including the Yurok, Tolowa, and Hupa tribes, who continue to maintain cultural ties to the land.
The parks preserve cultural heritage sites, including ancient village locations and traditional fishing grounds.
5. Recreational Activities:
Visitors can enjoy hiking, camping, fishing, and wildlife viewing. Popular trails include:
The Lady Bird Johnson Grove trail for accessible old-growth forest exploration.
The Tall Trees Grove, featuring some of the tallest known redwoods.
Scenic drives like the Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway offer breathtaking views.
6. Environmental Importance:
The redwoods are vital carbon sinks, capturing and storing significant amounts of carbon dioxide, which helps combat climate change.
The park protects watersheds and coastal ecosystems, maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity.
7. Conservation Efforts:
Logging during the 19th and early 20th centuries decimated much of the old-growth redwood forest, leading to the establishment of protected areas.
The park system is managed jointly by the National Park Service and the California Department of Parks and Recreation to ensure preservation and restoration.
Redwood National and State Parks Today:
The parks are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and part of the California Coast Ranges International Biosphere Reserve. They attract millions of visitors annually, offering a chance to experience awe-inspiring natural beauty and to learn about the importance of conserving these ancient giants and their ecosystems.
